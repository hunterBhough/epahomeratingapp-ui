        <h3>1.3	All insulation achieves RESNET-defined Grade I installation. See Footnote 4 for alternatives. <sup>4</sup></h3>
        <dl><dt><p><i>Footnote 4:</i></dt><dd> Two alternatives are provided: a) Grade II cavity insulation is permitted to be used for assemblies that contain a layer of continuous, air impermeable insulation ≥ R-3 in Climate Zones 1 to 4, ≥ R-5 in Climate Zones 5 to 8; b) Grade II batts are permitted to be used in floors if they fill the full depth of the floor cavity, even when compression occurs due to excess insulation, as long as the R-value of the batts has been appropriately assessed based on manufacturer guidance and the only defect preventing the insulation from achieving Grade I is the compression caused by the excess insulation.</dd>
