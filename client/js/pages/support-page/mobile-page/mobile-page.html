            <h3>RaterPRO Mobile App</h3>

            <accordion idnum="1" title="Mobile App Overview">
                <p>The RaterPRO mobile app is used by Raters to perform inspections in the field. The typical workflow is to select the day’s jobs, make them Available Offline, and ensure the sync status is up to date before leaving for the day. Perform inspections and make edits as needed. At the end of the day, open up the RaterPRO app when back on a network and let the app complete a sync.</p>

                <p>Here are the key features of the RaterPRO app’s landing page:</p>

                <p><strong>Tabs</strong> along the top allow filtering the jobs list by status (for example, completed jobs)</p>
                
                <p><strong>Sync Status</strong> is green when the app is on network and fully synced with the cloud. Blue indicates syncing is in progress. Grey indicates the app is offline. Yellow means there are active edits ready to sync as soon as the app gets back online.</p>

                <p><strong>Completion Percentages</strong> circles show the fraction of pre-drywall and final items that are completed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Available Offline</strong> toggles allow syncing all assets, including photos and PDFs, for viewing offline.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Create a Job</strong> button lets you create new jobs on the fly from any rating file loaded into your Template Library.</p>

            </accordion>
            <accordion idnum="2" title="Making Jobs Available Offline">
                <p>Before heading out for an inspection, it’s best to make those jobs available offline. This will guarantee that all job information, including photos and attached PDFs, are viewable even without a network connection.</p>

                <p>Toggle the ‘Available Offline’ button to green to make the job available in offline mode. Wait for the Sync Status to return to green to ensure all jobs have been completely loaded for offline access. The job(s) can now be easily accessed on the Offline Jobs tab.</p>

                <p>Textual information for all jobs, regardless of offline status, are available for users offline. The only information not accessible are pictures and PDFs.</p>
            </accordion>
            <accordion idnum="3" title="Opening a Job">
                <p>Select a job from the list to open. Inspection items are organized on six tabs. Within each tab, items are further organized into pre-drywall and final inspection sections. A colored bar above each stab shows the pre-drywall completion percentage, and the bar below each tab show the final completion percentage.</p>

                <p><strong>Minimum Rated Features</strong> are shown for all jobs. Scroll left and right in each table to see full details. Click a row of a table to edit details.</p>

                <p><strong>ENERGY STAR Checklist Items</strong> are shown for ENERGY STAR jobs.</p>

                <p><strong>Status</strong> buttons (Rater Verified, N/A, etc.) are next to each inspection item</p>

                <p><strong>Comment</strong> buttons can capture text comments and photos.</p>

            <accordion idnum="4" title="Filter Inspection Items">
                <p>By default, all inspection items are shown. Select the ‘Filter’ button to narrow down the list by stage (pre-drywall vs. final) or status (To-do or Must Correct). For example, on a pre-drywall inspection you can filter to only see the pre-drywall items.</p>

            <accordion idnum="5" title="Editing Minimum Rated Feature">
                
                <p>Most fields can be edited in the RaterPRO Mobile App. To edit, find the row in the table that requires updating. Click on that row. Next, a details window titled ‘Edit Windows’ will appear. </p>

                <p>Edit any field in the ‘Edit Windows’ screen, click on the cell to update the value and click ‘Save’ in the top right corner. The edited row will then be highlighted yellow to notate a change had been made in the field and confirmed as accurate data.</p>

                <p>Even if you’re not editing, the ‘Edit Windows’ screen is a great tool to reference intricate job details.</p>
