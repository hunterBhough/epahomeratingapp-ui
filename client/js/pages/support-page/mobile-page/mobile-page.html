                        <p>The RaterPRO mobile app is used by Raters to perform inspections in the field. The typical workflow is to select the day’s jobs, make them Available Offline, and ensure the sync status is up to date before leaving for the day. Perform inspections and make edits as needed. At the end of the day, open up the RaterPRO app when back on a network and let the app complete a sync.</p>

                        <p>Here are the key features of the RaterPRO app’s landing page:</p>

                        <p><strong>Tabs</strong> along the top allow filtering the jobs list by status (for example, completed jobs)</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Sync Status</strong> is green when the app is on network and fully synced with the cloud. Blue indicates syncing is in progress. Grey indicates the app is offline. Yellow means there are active edits ready to sync as soon as the app gets back online.</p>

                        <p><strong>Completion Percentages</strong> circles show the fraction of pre-drywall and final items that are completed.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Available Offline</strong> toggles allow syncing all assets, including photos and PDFs, for viewing offline.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Create a Job</strong> button lets you create new jobs on the fly from any rating file loaded into your Template Library.</p>

                        <p>Before heading out for an inspection, it’s best to make those jobs available offline. This will guarantee that all job information, including photos and attached PDFs, are viewable even without a network connection.</p>

                        <p>Toggle the ‘Available Offline’ button to green to make the job available in offline mode. Wait for the Sync Status to return to green to ensure all jobs have been completely loaded for offline access. The job(s) can now be easily accessed on the Offline Jobs tab.</p>
