                <p>Any contact with a <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=mesa.showlogin" target="_blank">My ENERGY STAR Account (MESA)</a> can be added to an organization’s RaterPRO account. You can add additional contacts through MESA or by contacting <a href="mailto:energystarhomes@energystar.gov" target="_blank">energystarhomes@energystar.gov</a>.</p>

                <p>When an organization begins using RaterPRO, an account invitation e-mail will be sent to the primary contact. That primary RaterPRO user can then invite additional users on the ‘Users’ tab. </p>

                <p>The Users tab shows a list of eligible users, based on the organizations MESA account. Users with Rater, Rater Admin or Provider permissions checked already have accounts. To invite a new user, select one or more permissions check boxes (Rater, Rater Admin or Provider) for that user and click ‘Save’, which will trigger an automated invitation e-mail to the email address listed for that user.</p>

                <p>Note: e-mail addresses are based on contact’s My ENERGY STAR Account (MESA) and, if incorrect, should be updated through MESA. Updates will be reflected in RaterPRO within 24 hours.</p>

                <p>When a new home is ready to be rated it’s time to create a job within RaterPRO. On the Rater Jobs tab, click <strong>Create a Job</strong>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rating Type – Indicate if this is an ENERGY STAR rating, or a HERS-only rating</li>

                    <li>Rating File – Jobs are pre-populated with the expected features from the projected energy model. Either select the XML file directly from your computer or from your Template Library. The Template Library is useful for files you will use repeatedly.</li>

                    <li>Export Filename – Now is a good time to enter a meaningful filename for the XML file that will be exported at the job’s completion. This might include the address or other identifying information to set it apart from other files in your downloads folder.</li>
