You can add additional contacts through MESA or by contacting <a href="mailto:energystarhomes@energystar.gov" target="_blank">energystarhomes@energystar.gov</a>.</p>

                        <p>When an organization begins using RaterPRO, an account invitation e-mail will be sent to the primary contact. That primary RaterPRO user can then invite additional users on the ‘Users’ tab. </p>

                        <p>The Users tab shows a list of eligible users, based on the organizations MESA account. Users with Rater, Rater Admin or Provider permissions checked already have accounts. To invite a new user, select one or more permissions check boxes (Rater, Rater Admin or Provider) for that user and click ‘Save’, which will trigger an automated invitation e-mail to the email address listed for that user.</p>

                        <p>Note: e-mail addresses are based on contact’s My ENERGY STAR Account (MESA) and, if incorrect, should be updated through MESA. Updates will be reflected in RaterPRO within 24 hours.</p>

            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

            <p>The use of the RaterPRO tool in general, and use of any specific features of the website and app, is completely optional. Partners are not required to use RaterPRO to participate in the ENERGY STAR Certified Homes program. RaterPRO users are solely responsible for the information that they collect using the tool, and by using RaterPRO, affirm that they have obtained all necessary permissions from information owners.</p>

            <p>The information that can be collected using RaterPRO is based on: (1) the ‘minimum rated features’ defined by the ANSI/RESNET/ICC 301 Standard for the Calculation and Labeling of the Energy Performance of Low-Rise Residential Buildings using an Energy Rating Index standard; and (2) the ENERGY STAR Certified Homes program requirements. Additionally, users have the option to use RaterPRO to collect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home address</strong> (alternatively, users may choose to use an anonymized manual identifier);</li>
                <li><strong>Comments about a home</strong> (alternatively, users may elect not to add comments); or</li>
                <li><strong>Photos to accompany comments</strong> (RaterPRO requires only a photo of the front elevation of each rated home. All other photos are optional).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>EPA, through its technical support contractor, may access information collected in RaterPRO solely for the following purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Support Requests</strong> – With RaterPRO users’ express written or verbal permission, EPA’s technical support contractor may temporarily access collected information solely for diagnostic purposes to resolve a user’s support request.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing System Development</strong> – EPA’s technical support contractor may temporarily access stored information during the normal course of system development and maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Anonymized Usage Statistics</strong> – EPA’s technical support contractor may generate anonymized usage statistics, which will not identify any specific RaterPRO users or homes, to maintain and improve the tool.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>EPA and its technical support contractor, will NOT:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Access any information collected using RaterPRO beyond the time necessary to perform the specific task related to the purposes listed above.</li>
                <li>Create any new databases featuring information collected using RaterPRO.</li>
                <li>Share any information collected using RaterPRO with any other parties, unless required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information Control and Sharing</h3>

            <p>RaterPRO offers two ways to share information. Use of either feature is entirely optional.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sharing Information with Accredited Providers</strong> – A user may choose to share a home’s record with their Accredited Provider using the ‘Submit to Provider’ feature. When shared, the Provider will have access to all information associated with the record, including home profile (location, builder and plan name), record history (dates of edits and identity of the editor), status of ‘minimum rated features,’ status of ENERGY STAR checklist requirements, comments, and photos. Once a user shares a home’s record with an Accredited Provider, the user will not be able to “unshare” that record.</li>
                <li><strong>Sharing Information via Reports</strong> – Users may choose to share home information with third parties using one of RaterPRO’s reports, such as the Builder Corrections report. In this case, RaterPRO will generate a PDF report which can then be sent to a third party via e-mail, text message, or other communication system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each authorized user in an organization can view, edit, and delete information collected within RaterPRO by that organization’s own users. A RaterPRO user may delete an entire record for a home, unless that home’s record has already been shared with the organization’s Accredited Provider. After 30 days, a deleted record will be permanently erased and will not be retrievable.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>The security of user information is of critical importance to the EPA. We have designed RaterPRO with the following security features:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure, Password Protected Access</strong> – Upon registration, users establish a unique username and password. Users may their change username and password at any point on the “Settings” page.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Communications</strong> – All data communicated over the web are secured by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect data transmissions. No information is transferred openly over the web.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Servers</strong> – All information collected within RaterPRO is stored and maintained on commercial servers that use industry-standard security protocols. No information collected using RaterPRO is stored on EPA equipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While EPA has taken steps to ensure the security and stability of RaterPRO, there is a possibility of data loss and/or system downtime. EPA shall not be liable for any loss of data, loss of profits, loss of business, loss of use or any other economic loss.</p>

            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>EPA reserves the right to change our policies regarding the privacy of your information in the future. If that happens, we will endeavor to promptly update this Privacy Policy and provide a message to RaterPRO users.</p>
