            <h3>User Guide</h3>

            <p>The user guide is organized into three sections:</p>

            <p><strong>RaterPRO Desktop</strong> – Learn how to use RaterPRO’s web interface to create and review jobs.</p>

            <p><strong>RaterPRO Mobile App</strong> – Learn how to use RaterPRO’s mobile app to perform inspections in the field.</p>

            <p><strong>Providers</strong> – As a quality assurance provider, learn how to review jobs submitted by rating companies.</p>


            <accordion idnum="1" title="User Types">
                <p>Before diving into the user guide, it’s important to understand the three types of users around which RaterPRO’s workflow is structured:</p>

                <p><strong>Rater Admins</strong> are office staff who create jobs and review inspection results. They also control user permissions and invitations for the organization’s account. Rater Admins use the RaterPRO Desktop site.</p>

                <p><strong>Raters</strong> are HERS raters who perform inspections using the RaterPRO mobile app, edit inspection checklist items, and make the final decision to mark a job as ‘complete.’ Raters spend most of their time on the mobile app.</p>

                <p><strong>Providers</strong> review submitted jobs from rating companies. They also control user permissions. Providers use the RaterPRO Desktop site. </p>

            <accordion idnum="2" title="RaterPRO Workflow">
                <p>RaterPRO jobs start and end in the energy modeling software. In between, RaterPRO’s core workflow is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rater Admin creates a job in RaterPRO by importing the XML from energy modeling software.</li>
                    <li>Rater performs inspections using the mobile app.</li>
                    <li>Rater ‘completes’ the job once all items are satisfactory.</li>
                    <li> Rater Admin reviews the job.</li>
                    <li>Rater Admin exports the job to energy modeling software (via XML file) and calculate the final HERS score.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, Rater Admin shares job with Provider who refers to job records during their QA review.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The guide will explain each of these steps in detail. If you have any further questions, please contact the ENERGY STAR team at <a href="mailto:energystarhomes@energystar.gov">energystarhomes@energystar.gov</a>.</p>
