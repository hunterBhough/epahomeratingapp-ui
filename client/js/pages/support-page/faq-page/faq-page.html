            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

            <p>See below for frequently asked questions from RaterPRO users.</p>

            <accordion idnum="1" title="Why are the pictures and comments that I made in the field not appearing on the RaterPRO website?">
                <p>Syncing from the iPad will occur when the app is open and the tablet is connected to the internet. The best practice is to open the app in the office at the end of the day, where the tablet will have a wifi connection.</p>

                <p>Make sure you have connectivity on your tablet by navigating to a web site in the browser. Then return to the RaterPRO app and check that the sync status on the Job List screen is blue (‘Syncing’) or green (‘Up to date’). Sync time will depend on the network speed and number of photos taken but, in general, should complete within 5 minutes.</p>

                <p>If the sync status appears to be stuck, try pressing the “Refresh Job List” on the Job list screen.</p>

                <p>Once the iPad syncs, the images will be viewable on the admin web site.</p>

            <accordion idnum="2" title="Can I share my RaterPRO reports with my Provider if they do not use RaterPRO?">
                <p>The easiest way to share field data with your Provider is to invite them to use RaterPRO. The ENERGY STAR team will be happy to help get them set up. Simply contact us at <a href="mailto:energystarhomes@energystar.gov" target="_blank">energystarhomes@energystar.gov</a>.</p>
                <p>If your Provider does not wish to join RaterPRO you can still share the Archival Report in PDF format. The archival report records all of the important information associated with a job. Review ‘Export PDF Reports’ in the RaterPRO Desktop User Guide for guidance on how to save a copy of this report.</p>

            <accordion idnum="3" title="Does RaterPRO geo-tag photos?">
                <p>Yes, RaterPRO does geo-tag photos. The recorded location is shown on the Job History screen and in the Archival Report.</p>
                <p>Geo-tagging accuracy is limited by your mobile devices capability and may not be available on some devices.</p>
