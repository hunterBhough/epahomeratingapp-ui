            <accordion idnum="1" title="Provider Overview">
                <p>Provider companies may optionally join RaterPRO to review jobs submitted by rating companies operating under their providership. Companies that are joint raters/providers will automatically have both functions available to them.</p>
                <p>The main reason for a Provider to user RaterPRO is to have access to the rich job information like the elevation photos, comments with photos, and job history with geo-tagging during their QA reviews.</p>
                <p>Note that RaterPRO does not generate HERS scores and Providers should still expect to receive the completed HERS modeling files from Raters. RaterPRO does not replace the final energy modeling step.</p>

            <accordion idnum="2" title="Link Providership to a Rating Company">
                <p>Before Raters can share jobs with a Provider, the Provider has to link the rating company with their Providership. From the ‘Users’ tab, select the ‘Rating Companies’ section. Select the ‘+ Add Rating Company’ icon, select the company from the dropdown, and click ‘Add’. The admin users from the rating company will receive an invitation email and, once they accept the link, will be able to submit jobs to you for review.</p>

                <p>Providers will see jobs that have been submitted to them on the ‘Providers Jobs’ tab. If connected to more than one rating company, select a company from the dropdown menu to view the jobs which they’ve submitted to your providership.</p>

            <accordion idnum="4" title="Add Job Comments">
                <p>A Provider can attach general comments, for example comments from the QA review, via the ‘Job Comments’ button on the bottom bar. Add comments and hit ‘Save’.</p>

                <img data-ng-click="supportPageCtrl.showOriginalImg($event)" src="img/support/image068.png" />

            <accordion idnum="5" title="Manage Registered Jobs">
                <p>Once a Provider completes quality assurance on a job and registers the job in energy modeling software, they may wish to mark that job as registered within RaterPRO in order to keep their “inbox” organized. Note that RaterPRO has no connection to the RESNET registry; jobs must still be registered via energy modeling software; and marking a job as ‘Registered’ within RaterPRO does not actually register the job. The ‘Mark as Registered’ feature in RaterPRO is for internal record keeping purposes only.</p>

                <p><strong>Mark a Single Job:</strong> Open the job and click the ‘Mark as Registered’ icon at the top of the screen for an individual job.</p>

                <img src="img/support/image069.png" />
                <span class="img_label">Mark Job as Registered</span>

                <p><strong>Mark Multiple Jobs:</strong> On the Provider Jobs list, check the job(s) you’d like to share, and click ‘Mark as Registered’. </p>

                <span class="img_label">Mark Multiple Jobs as Registered</span>

                <p>All registered projects in RaterPRO can be found in the ‘Registered’ section on the Providers Job tab.</p>
