                <h4>Rating Software</h4>
                <p>RaterPRO supports file exchange with the latest versions of REM/Rate, Ekotrope, and EnergyGauge (v 5.2.00 or greater) software.</p>
                <p>Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>See instructions below for configuring Ekorope’s settings for best compatibility.</li>
                    <li>‘Threshold Ratings’ are not supported at this time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Configuring Ekotrope’s settings for best compatibility</h4>
                <p>If using Ekotrope, two settings are critical for the best experience. Navigate to Ekotrope’s settings page using the button on the top right while logged in to <a href="https://app.ekotrope.com/#settings" target="_blank">app.Ekotrope.com</a>. We recommend two settings:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set the <i>REM/Rate™ XML Export Version</i> to <strong>“<u>15.7 and later</u>”</strong></li>
                    <li><strong><u>Uncheck</u></strong> the box for <i>Add new component types and utility rates of imported project(s) to your organization's library?</i></li>
                </ol>
